\"Something\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from
their 1969 album Abbey Road. It was written by George Harrison,
the band's lead guitarist. Together with his second contribution
to Abbey Road, \"Here Comes the Sun\", it is widely viewed by music
historians as having marked Harrison's ascendancy as a composer to
the level of the Beatles' principal songwriters, John Lennon and
Paul McCartney.
